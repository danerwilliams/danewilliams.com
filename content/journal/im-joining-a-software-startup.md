A few months ago, I saw on Linkedin that a fellow [vampire](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme), [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/) had started a new job at a startup called [WorkOS](https://workos.com/).
He said the team was looking to bring on more software engineers, so I scheduled a call and learned more about the company from him.

I quickly became very impressed by what Zeno had shared with me about the company as well as from the research I had done and began the interview process.
I've always loved building tools for other developers, therefore I thought that going to a company that makes API's seemed like an awesome opportunity.
After meeting many more members of the team and going through multiple interview rounds I finally had an offer and could not have been more excited to join.

Working in an organization of this size that is getting ready to grow incredibly fast is an exceptionally unique opportunity and I'm sure I will have virtually unlimited opportunities to learn and grow while making an impact on the company.
I'll be joining as the 9th engineering hire and can't wait to get started in January after I graduate from Notre Dame.
So stoked to share more about this awesome experience!
