Today, I'm super excited to launch Charcoal, and open source CLI for stacking PRs with git!

Charcoal is a fork of [Graphite](https://graphite.dev), that integrates directly to GitHub using the GitHub CLI as a dependency. 
This means you can start stacking PRs in GitHub today by simply running `brew install danerwilliams/tap/charcoal`, no permissions from your organization administrator necessary.

### Background

I had been using Graphite for about a year and a half prior to building Charcoal, and absolutely recommend you try out their products. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't make sense yet for WorkOS to start using their other products such as the code review platform and merge queue, so we opted not to purchase a team plan when Graphite launched out of beta. For that reason, the inspiration behind Charcoal was born. 

If you try out Charcoal and find that you're liking it, definitely check out Graphite's code review platform and merge queue, you might like those too :-)

Btw, if you work at Graphite and are reading this, I'm always down to chat! Big fan of what the Graphite team is building.

### Demo!

Since I've found that writing long blog posts becomes fairly boring at times, I decided to mix things up and record a demo video where I explain stacked PR's, why you might want to introduce them to your workflow, and how you can start using them with Charcoal or Graphite.

Enjoy!
