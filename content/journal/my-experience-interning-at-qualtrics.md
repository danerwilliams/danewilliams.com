Over the summer I interned at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) which is an enterprise SaaS company that pioneered the experience management category.
This was a really cool experience as it was essentially the first time I worked in a modern software engineering team environment.
I was a part of the PX - Frontline Feedback product team, which is responsible for both building new features for Qualtrics Frontline Feedback, as well as maintaining the product's platform.

During my 12 weeks there I was tasked with building a new feature for Frontline Feedback that would integrate data from Salesforce, so that Frontline Feedback could manage their account data all in Salesforce and then import into Qualtrics in order to maintain a single source of truth.
In order to build this feature I had to work across the full technology stack our team worked with, including TypeScript, React, Redux, and Node.

In addition to the valuable professional experience the internship provided, there was also lots of fun opportunities to meet new people!
We were remote for this internship, so I got to talk to a lot of the other interns from across the country on Slack and Zoom.
However, Qualtrics also paid for us to have a week long visit to the Seattle office, so I finally got to meet my team members and fellow interns in person!
During the trip we went boating, attended a mariners game, and explored downtown Seattle (the new Qualtrics tower is in the heart of downtown right next to Benaroya Hall where my high school graduation took place).
Below are a few photos from the trip :-)

Ultimately, in the process of building my feature I learned all about working in a large codebase with many contributors and how to effectively maintain it, while also improving my full stack development skills.
From writing automated tests, to improving the readability of my code, I got tons of valuable feedback from the other members of the team on every merge request I submitted this summer and I am much stronger developer as a result.

My code is currently in our production codebase and is hidden from external users with our feature flipper.
Soon enough it will be published to Qualtrics customers world wide, I can't wait for people to start benefiting from it!

Thank you to everyone at Qualtrics who made this such a great internship experience!
