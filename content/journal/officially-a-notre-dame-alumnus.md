After 7 semesters, I can finally call myself a Notre Dame alum!

There have been so many memories made these past few years, from some of the awesome football wins we've had (especially thinking about the 2020 Clemson game) to the amazing friends I've met in [Fisher](https://fisher.nd.edu/#/) and on [water polo](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/).
Of course, it was not all easy.
Between Covid, difficult classes, and the cold weather, there were plenty of struggles, but it was all worth it and I could not have asked for a better college experience.

Due to several circumstances I wound up a bit ahead on my credits and made the decision to graduate a semester early with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
I'll still walk with my classmates in May 2022, and plan to stay in South Bend with my college roommates during the spring 2022 semester.
Since the company I'm working for, [WorkOS](https://workos.com/), is fully remote I'm able to sort of continue living the college life until May graduation while still getting a head start on my career and will start working for them in January.
After my college friends graduate, I plan to move to New York City with them some time early fall or late summer of 2022.

Now that I've completed my degree, here's a list of all the classes I took.
