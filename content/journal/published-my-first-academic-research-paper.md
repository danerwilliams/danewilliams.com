During the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters I have been working on a research project in Professor Chaoli Wang's [Visualization Lab](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/team/) here at Notre Dame.
My team and I have been studying Sankey diagrams, and how we can better illustrate data flow.
Specifically we have been analyzing data from [ND Learning](https://learning.nd.edu/), an organization on campus that aims to improve learning experiences at Notre Dame for people of all backgrounds.

In our research we have examined data from an introductory chemistry course at the university, and have been coming up with different ways to show the data flow of student's grades changing over the course of a semester.
To do this we implemented several variations to sankey diagrams using the popular JavaScript data visualization library, [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
You can view these visualizations [here](https://fwr008wy2p.pstb.in/src/combined/index.html).

Earlier this year we learned that our research paper was accepted to the [International Symposium on Visual Computing](https://www.isvc.net/)!
Our work was presented at the conference, and now it has been published to their journal.
