Welcome to my new personal site, [danewilliams.com](https://danewilliams.com)!

### I decided to build this for a few reasons

- I've been doing more frontend at work recently and felt it would be good practice
- I wanted to try designing something cool
- I want to use my site as a playground for experimentation, which I could not do on my [old site](https://github.com/danerwilliams/danewilliams.me) built with Hugo
- My old site was built sophomore year of college and looks outdated

### Look at the cool markdown!

Checkout the `inline` and block code styling built using [Dracula for Prism](https://draculatheme.com/prism)

```ts
let message: string = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(message);
```
